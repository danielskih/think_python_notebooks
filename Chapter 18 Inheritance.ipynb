If you don’t play poker, you can read about it at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker, but you don’t have to; I’ll tell you what you need to know for the exercises.Code examples from this chapter are availabe from http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/code/Card.py. \n",

    "### 18.1 Card objects \n",
    "There are fifty-two cards in a deck, each of which belongs to one of four suits and one of thirteen ranks. The suits are Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, and Clubs (in descending order in bridge). The ranks are Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, and King. Depending on the game that you are playing, an Ace may be higher than King or lower than 2. \n",
    "If we want to define a new object to represent a playing card, it is obvious what the at- tributes should be: rank and suit. It is not as obvious what type the attributes should be. One possibility is to use strings containing words like 'Spade' for suits and 'Queen' for ranks. One problem with this implementation is that it would not be easy to compare cards to see which had a higher rank or suit. \n",
    "An alternative is to use integers to encode the ranks and suits. In this context, “encode” means that we are going to define a mapping between numbers and suits, or between numbers and ranks. This kind of encoding is not meant to be a secret (that would be “encryption”). \n",
    "For example, this table shows the suits and the corresponding integer codes: \n",
    "Spades 􏰀→ 3 Hearts 􏰀→ 2 Diamonds 􏰀→ 1 Clubs 􏰀→ 0 \n",
    "This code makes it easy to compare cards; because higher suits map to higher numbers, we can compare suits by comparing their codes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The mapping for ranks is fairly obvious; each of the numerical ranks maps to the corre- sponding integer, and for face cards: \n",
    "Jack 􏰀→ 11 Queen 􏰀→ 12 King 􏰀→ 13 \n",
    "I am using the 􏰀→ symbol to make it clear that these mappings are not part of the Python program. They are part of the program design, but they don’t appear explicitly in the code. \n",
    "The class definition for Card looks like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "    class Card(object): \n",
    "        \"\"\"Represents a standard playing card.\"\"\" \n",
    "        def __init__(self, suit=0, rank=2): \n",
    "            self.suit = suit \n",
    "            self.rank = rank \n",
    "As usual, the init method takes an optional parameter for each attribute. The default card is the 2 of Clubs. \n",
    "To create a Card, you call Card with the suit and rank of the card you want. queen_of_diamonds = Card(1, 12) \n",
    "### 18.2 Class attributes \n",
    "In order to print Card objects in a way that people can easily read, we need a mapping from the integer codes to the corresponding ranks and suits. A natural way to do that is with lists of strings. We assign these lists to class attributes: "

    "The answer might depend on what game you are playing, but to keep things simple, we’ll make the arbitrary choice that suit is more important, so all of the Spades outrank all of the Diamonds, and so on. \n",

    "### 18.7 Inheritance \n",
    "The language feature most often associated with object-oriented programming is inheritance. Inheritance is the ability to define a new class that is a modified version of an existing class. \n",
    "It is called “inheritance” because the new class inherits the methods of the existing class. Extending this metaphor, the existing class is called the parent and the new class is called the child. \n",
    "As an example, let’s say we want a class to represent a “hand,” that is, the set of cards held by one player. A hand is similar to a deck: both are made up of a set of cards, and both require operations like adding and removing cards. \n",
    "A hand is also different from a deck; there are operations we want for hands that don’t make sense for a deck. For example, in poker we might compare two hands to see which one wins. In bridge, we might compute a score for a hand in order to make a bid. \n",
    "This relationship between classes—similar, but different—lends itself to inheritance. \n",
    "The definition of a child class is like other class definitions, but the name of the parent class appears in parentheses: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    class Hand(Deck): \n",
    "    \"\"\"Represents a hand of playing cards.\"\"\" \n",
    "This definition indicates that Hand inherits from Deck; that means we can use methods like pop_card and add_card for Hands as well as Decks. \n",
    "Hand also inherits __init__ from Deck, but it doesn’t really do what we want: instead of populating the hand with 52 new cards, the init method for Hands should initialize cards with an empty list. \n",
    "If we provide an init method in the Hand class, it overrides the one in the Deck class: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    # inside class Hand: \n",
    "        def __init__(self, label=''): \n",
    "            self.cards = [] \n",
    "            self.label = label \n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- 18.8. Classdiagrams 173  -->\n",
    "\n",
    "So when you create a Hand, Python invokes this init method: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    >>> hand = Hand('new hand') \n",
    "    >>> print hand.cards \n",
    "    [] \n",
    "    >>> print hand.label \n",
    "    new hand \n",
    "    But the other methods are inherited from Deck, so we can use pop_card and add_card to deal a card: \n",
    "    >>> deck = Deck() \n",

    "    >>> hand.add_card(card) \n",

    "            hand.add_card(self.pop_card()) \n",
    "move_cards takes two arguments, a Hand object and the number of cards to deal. It modifies both self and hand, and returns None. \n",
    "In some games, cards are moved from one hand to another, or from a hand back to the deck. You can use move_cards for any of these operations: self can be either a Deck or a Hand, and hand, despite the name, can also be a Deck.\n",
    "### Exercise 18.3.\n",
    "Write a Deck method called deal_hands that takes two parameters, the number of hands and the number of cards per hand, and that creates new Hand objects, deals the appropriate number of cards per hand, and returns a list of Hand objects. \n",
    "Inheritance is a useful feature. Some programs that would be repetitive without inheritance can be written more elegantly with it. Inheritance can facilitate code reuse, since you can customize the behavior of parent classes without having to modify them. In some cases, the inheritance structure reflects the natural structure of the problem, which makes the program easier to understand. \n",
    "On the other hand, inheritance can make programs difficult to read. When a method is invoked, it is sometimes not clear where to find its definition. The relevant code may be scattered among several modules. Also, many of the things that can be done using inheritance can be done as well or better without it. \n",
    "18.8 Class diagrams \n",
    "So far we have seen stack diagrams, which show the state of a program, and object dia- grams, which show the attributes of an object and their values. These diagrams represent a snapshot in the execution of a program, so they change as the program runs. \n",
    "They are also highly detailed; for some purposes, too detailed. A class diagram is a more abstract representation of the structure of a program. Instead of showing individual ob- jects, it shows classes and the relationships between them. \n",
    "<!-- Figure 18.2: Class diagram.  -->\n",
    "There are several kinds of relationship between classes: \n",
    "•\tObjects in one class might contain references to objects in another class. For example, each Rectangle contains a reference to a Point, and each Deck contains references to many Cards. This kind of relationship is called HAS-A, as in, “a Rectangle has a Point.” \n",
    "\n",
    "•\tOne class might inherit from another. This relationship is called IS-A, as in, “a Hand is a kind of a Deck.” \n",
    "\n",
    "•\tOne class might depend on another in the sense that changes in one class would require changes in the other. \n",
    "A class diagram is a graphical representation of these relationships. For example, Fig- ure 18.2 shows the relationships between Card, Deck and Hand. \n",
    "The arrow with a hollow triangle head represents an IS-A relationship; in this case it indicates that Hand inherits from Deck. \n",
    "The standard arrow head represents a HAS-A relationship; in this case a Deck has references to Card objects. \n",
    "The star (*) near the arrow head is a multiplicity; it indicates how many Cards a Deck has. A multiplicity can be a simple number, like 52, a range, like 5..7 or a star, which indicates that a Deck can have any number of Cards.  ",
    "A more detailed diagram might show that a Deck actually contains a list of Cards, but built-in types like list and dict are usually not included in class diagrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 18.4. \n",
    "Read TurtleWorld.py, World.py and Gui.py and draw a class diagram that shows the relationships among the classes defined there. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 18.9 Debugging \n",
    "Inheritance can make debugging a challenge because when you invoke a method on an object, you might not know which method will be invoked. \n",
    "Suppose you are writing a function that works with Hand objects. You would like it to work with all kinds of Hands, like PokerHands, BridgeHands, etc. If you invoke a method like shuffle, you might get the one defined in Deck, but if any of the subclasses override this method, you’ll get that version instead. \n",
    "Any time you are unsure about the flow of execution through your program, the simplest solution is to add print statements at the beginning of the relevant methods. If Deck.shuffle prints a message that says something like Running Deck.shuffle, then as the program runs it traces the flow of execution. \n",
    "As an alternative, you could use this function, which takes an object and a method name (as a string) and returns the class that provides the definition of the method: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    def find_defining_class(obj, meth_name): \n",
    "        for ty in type(obj).mro(): \n",
    "        if meth_name in ty.__dict__: \n",
    "        return ty \n",
    "Here’s an example: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    >>> hand = Hand() \n",
    "    >>> print find_defining_class(hand, 'shuffle') \n",
    "    <class 'Card.Deck'> \n",
    "So the shuffle method for this Hand is the one in Deck.\n",
    "find_defining_class uses the mro method to get the list of class objects (types) that will \n",
    "be searched for methods. “MRO” stands for “method resolution order.” \n",
    "Here’s a program design suggestion: whenever you override a method, the interface of the new method should be the same as the old. It should take the same parameters, return the same type, and obey the same preconditions and postconditions. If you obey this rule, you will find that any function designed to work with an instance of a superclass, like a Deck, will also work with instances of subclasses like a Hand or PokerHand. \n",
    "If you violate this rule, your code will collapse like (sorry) a house of cards. \n",
    "Chapter 16 demonstrates a development plan we might call “object-oriented design.” We identified objects we needed — Time, Point and Rectangle —and defined classes to represent them. In each case there is an obvious correspondence between the object and some entity in the real world (or at least a mathematical world). \n",
    "But sometimes it is less obvious what objects you need and how they should interact. In that case you need a different development plan. In the same way that we discovered function interfaces by encapsulation and generalization, we can discover class interfaces by data encapsulation. \n",
    "Markov analysis, from Section 13.8, provides a good example. If you download my code from http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/code/markov.py, you’ll see that it uses two global variables—suffix_map and prefix—that are read and written from several functions. \n",
    "suffix_map = {} \n",
    "prefix = () \n",
    "Because these variables are global we can only run one analysis at a time. If we read two texts, their prefixes and suffixes would be added to the same data structures (which makes for some interesting generated text). \n",
    "To run multiple analyses, and keep them separate, we can encapsulate the state of each analysis in an object. Here’s what that looks like: \n",

    "PokerHand.py : An incomplete implementation of a class that represents a poker hand, and some code that tests it. \n",
    "\t2.\tIf you run PokerHand.py, it deals seven 7-card poker hands and checks to see if any of them contains a flush. Read this code carefully before you go on.  ",
    "\n",
    "\t3.\tAdd methods to PokerHand.py named has_pair, has_twopair, etc. that return True or False according to whether or not the hand meets the relevant criteria. Your code should work correctly for “hands” that contain any number of cards (although 5 and 7 are the most common sizes).  ",
    "\n",
    "\t4.\tWrite a method named classify that figures out the highest-value classification for a hand and sets the label attribute accordingly. For example, a 7-card hand might contain a flush and a pair; it should be labeled “flush”. \n",
    "    5. When you are convinced that your classification methods are working, the next step is to estimate the probabilities of the various hands. Write a function in PokerHand.py that shuffles a deck of cards, divides it into hands, classifies the hands, and counts the number of times various classifications appear. \n",
    "    6. Print a table of the classifications and their probabilities. Run your program with larger and larger numbers of hands until the output values converge to a reasonable degree of accuracy. Compare your results to the values at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_rankings . \n",

    "This exercise uses TurtleWorld from Chapter 4. You will write code that makes Turtles play tag. If you are not familiar with the rules of tag, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(game). \n",
    "\t1.\tDownload http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/code/Wobbler.py and run it. You should see a TurtleWorld with three Turtles. If you press the Run button, the Turtles wander at random.  ",
    "\n",
    "\t2.\tRead the code and make sure you understand how it works. The Wobbler class inherits from Turtle, which means that the Turtle methods lt, rt, fd and bk work on Wobblers.  ",
    "The step method gets invoked by TurtleWorld. It invokes steer, which turns the Turtle in the desired direction, wobble, which makes a random turn in proportion to the Turtle’s clumsiness, and move, which moves forward a few pixels, depending on the Turtle’s speed.  ",
    "\n",
    "\t3.\tCreate a file named Tagger.py. Import everything from Wobbler, then define a class named Tagger that inherits from Wobbler. Call make_world passing the Tagger class object as an argument.  ",
    "\n",
    "\t4.\tAdd a steer method to Tagger to override the one in Wobbler. As a starting place, write a version that always points the Turtle toward the origin. Hint: use the math function atan2 and the Turtle attributes x, y and heading.  ",
    "\n",
    "\t5.\tModify steer so that the Turtles stay in bounds. For debugging, you might want to use the Step button, which invokes step once on each Turtle.  ",
    "\n",
    "\t6.\tModify steer so that each Turtle points toward its nearest neighbor. Hint: Turtles have an attribute, world, that is a reference to the TurtleWorld they live in, and the TurtleWorld has an attribute, animals, that is a list of all Turtles in the world.  ",
    "\n",
    "\t7.\tModify steer so the Turtles play tag. You can add methods to Tagger and you can override steer and __init__, but you may not modify or override step, wobble or move. Also, steer is allowed to change the heading of the Turtle but not the position.  ",
    "Adjust the rules and your steer method for good quality play; for example, it should be possible for the slow Turtle to tag the faster Turtles eventually.  ",
