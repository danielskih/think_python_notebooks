    "I mentioned earlier that a dictionary is implemented using a hashtable and that means that the keys have to be hashable.\n",
    "A hash is a function that takes a value (of any kind) and returns an integer. Dictionaries use these integers, called hash values, to store and look up key-value pairs.\n",
    "This system works fine if the keys are immutable. But if the keys are mutable, like lists, bad things happen. For example, when you create a key-value pair, Python hashes the key and stores it in the corresponding location. If you modify the key and then hash it again, it would go to a different location. In that case you might have two entries for the same key, or you might not be able to find a key. Either way, the dictionary wouldn’t work correctly.\n",
    "That’s why the keys have to be hashable, and why mutable types like lists aren’t. The simplest way to get around this limitation is to use tuples, which we will see in the next chapter.\n",

You can either edit the files themselves, or (better) modify the program so it reads only the first n lines.\n",

    "A common cause of runtime errors is a value that is not the right type. For debugging this kind of error, it is often enough to print the type of a value.\n",
    "Write self-checks: Sometimes you can write code to check for errors automatically. For example, if you are computing the average of a list of numbers, you could check that the result is not greater than the largest element in the list or less than the smallest. This is called a “sanity check” because it detects results that are “insane.”\n",
    "Another kind of check compares the results of two different computations to see if they are consistent. This is called a “consistency check.”\n",

    "This was sent in by a fellow named Dan O’Leary. He came upon a common one-syllable, five-letter word recently that has the following unique property. When you remove the first letter, the remaining letters form a homophone of the original word, that is a word that sounds exactly the same. Replace the first letter, that is, put it back and remove the second letter and the result is yet another homophone of the original word. And the question is, what’s the word?\n",
    "Now I’m going to give you an example that doesn’t work. Let’s look at the five-letter word, ‘wrack.’ W-R-A-C-K, you know like to ‘wrack with pain.’ If I remove the first letter, I am left with a four-letter word, ’R-A-C-K.’ As in, ‘Holy cow, did you see the rack on that buck! It must have been a nine-pointer!’ It’s a perfect homophone. If you put the ‘w’ back, and remove the ‘r,’ instead, you’re left with the word, ‘wack,’ which is a real word, it’s just not a homophone of the other two words.\n",
    "But there is, however, at least one word that Dan and we know of, which will yield two homophones if you remove either of the first two letters to make two, new four-letter words. The question is, what’s the word?\n",
    "You can use the dictionary from Exercise 11.1 to check whether a string is in the word list.\n",
    "To check whether two words are homophones, you can use the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary. You can download it from http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict or from http: // thinkpython. com/ code/ c06d and you can also download http: // thinkpython. com/ code/ pronounce. py , which provides a function named read_dictionary that reads the pronouncing dictionary and returns a Python dictionary that maps from each word to a string that describes its primary pronunciation.\n",
