Solution: http: // thinkpython. com/ code/ unstable_ sort. py .\n",
    "12.8 Sequences of sequences\n",
    "I have focused on lists of tuples, but almost all of the examples in this chapter also work with lists of lists, tuples of tuples, and tuples of lists. To avoid enumerating the possible combinations, it is sometimes easier to talk about sequences of sequences.\n",
    "In many contexts, the different kinds of sequences (strings, lists and tuples) can be used interchangeably. So how and why do you choose one over the others?\n",
    "To start with the obvious, strings are more limited than other sequences because the ele- ments have to be characters. They are also immutable. If you need the ability to change the characters in a string (as opposed to creating a new string), you might want to use a list of characters instead.\n",
    "Lists are more common than tuples, mostly because they are mutable. But there are a few cases where you might prefer tuples:\n",
    "1. In some contexts, like a return statement, it is syntactically simpler to create a tuple than a list. In other contexts, you might prefer a list.\n",
    "2. If you want to use a sequence as a dictionary key, you have to use an immutable type like a tuple or string.\n",
    "3. If you are passing a sequence as an argument to a function, using tuples reduces the potential for unexpected behavior due to aliasing.\n",
    "Because tuples are immutable, they don’t provide methods like sort and reverse, which modify existing lists. But Python provides the built-in functions sorted and reversed, which take any sequence as a parameter and return a new list with the same elements in a different order.\n",
    "12.9 Debugging\n",
    "Lists, dictionaries and tuples are known generically as data structures; in this chapter we are starting to see compound data structures, like lists of tuples, and dictionaries that con- tain tuples as keys and lists as values. Compound data structures are useful, but they are prone to what I call shape errors; that is, errors caused when a data structure has the wrong type, size or composition. For example, if you are expecting a list with one integer and I give you a plain old integer (not in a list), it won’t work.\n",
    "To help debug these kinds of errors, I have written a module called structshape that provides a function, also called structshape, that takes any kind of data structure as an argument and returns a string that summarizes its shape. You can download it from http://thinkpython.com/code/structshape.py\n",
    "Here’s the result for a simple list:\n",
    ">>> from structshape import structshape\n",
    ">>> t = [1,2,3]\n",
    ">>> print structshape(t)\n",
    "list of 3 int\n",
    "A fancier program might write “list of 3 ints,” but it was easier not to deal with plurals. Here’s a list of lists:\n",
    ">>> t2 = [[1,2], [3,4], [5,6]]\n",
    ">>> print structshape(t2)\n",
    "list of 3 list of 2 int\n",
    "If the elements of the list are not the same type, structshape groups them, in order, by type:\n",
    ">>> t3 = [1, 2, 3, 4.0, '5', '6', [7], [8], 9]\n",
    ">>> print structshape(t3)\n",
    "list of (3 int, float, 2 str, 2 list of int, int)\n",
    "Here’s a list of tuples:\n",
    ">>> s = 'abc'\n",
    ">>> lt = zip(t, s)\n",
    ">>> print structshape(lt)\n",
