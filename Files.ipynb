This command provides an efficient way to check whether two files have the same contents. The probability that different contents yield the same checksum is very small (that is, unlikely to happen before the universe collapses).\n",

    "__name__ is a built-in variable that is set when the program starts. If the program is running as a script, __name__ has the value __main__; in that case, the test code is executed. Otherwise, if the module is being imported, the test code is skipped.\n",

Others use a return character, represented \\r. Some use both. If you move files between different systems, these inconsistencies might cause problems.\n",
